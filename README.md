Welcome to Chat_GPT_Clone, a fantastic project that brings the power of chatbot technology to your fingertips! ðŸ¤–âœ¨ In this clone, we've recreated the magic of GPT-based chatbots. Follow the simple steps below to unleash the conversational potential of this exciting project.

## Getting Started

1. **Add Your API Key:**
   Open the `view.py` file inside the `chatbot` folder and add your GPT API key. This step ensures that your chatbot connects to the GPT service seamlessly.

   ```python
   # Inside chatbot/view.py
   GPT_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
   ```

2. **Open Terminal:**
   Fire up your terminal to navigate through the project. This is where the magic begins!

3. **Run the Server:**
   Execute the following command to start the Django server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Watch as your chatbot server comes to life!

4. **View Database:**
   For a visual exploration of the database, we recommend using the SQLite extension in Visual Studio Code. Dive into the data behind the chatbot's interactions to better understand its learning and responses.

## Usage

Now that your server is up and running, it's time to experience the chatbot in action. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the chatbot interface. Engage in conversations, ask questions, and marvel at the AI-driven responses.

Feel free to explore the code, customize the chatbot's behavior, and adapt it to your specific needs.
